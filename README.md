# Mobile Programming - React Native Lab 4
## Project: ProfileCardApp

This project is a polished "Profile Card" application built with React Native and Expo as part of the CMP437 Application Development On Android Devices 2025-2026 lab coursework.

The project focuses on advanced styling techniques and responsiveness in React Native. It demonstrates key concepts such as loading custom fonts with `expo-font`, creating a scalable design system (Theme Support for Light/Dark modes), implementing cross-platform shadows, building responsive layouts using `useWindowDimensions`, and adding interactivity with `Pressable` and `LayoutAnimation`.

**Bonus Features Implemented:**
* **Theme Toggle:** Switch between Light and Dark modes dynamically.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts layout for phones (portrait) and tablets/large screens.
* **Multiple Profiles:** Uses `FlatList` to render multiple profile cards.
* **Interactive Elements:** Like and Follow buttons with state management and console logging.
* **Expandable Cards:** "View Details" button reveals extra information with smooth layout animations.
